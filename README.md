## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo contains circuit, firmware and backend for SmartFootball Project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites <a name = "Prerequisites"></a>

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
- Raspberry Pi Model 3B, 3B+, 4B or CM4
```

## Installation and Configuration <a name = "Installation_and_Config"></a>

A step by step series that covers how to get the Firmware running.

### Raspberry Pi Firmware Pre-Reqs

1.  Download and install the latest Raspberry Pi OS Desktop image to your SD card
2.  Open the terminal and execute the following command
    ```sudo raspi-config```
3. Then follow the following pictures to enable I2C bus on you raspberry pi

* ![R2](artwork/r2.png)
* ![R3](artwork/r3.png)
* ![R4](artwork/r4.png)
* ![R5](artwork/r5.png)

* Then do the same for Serial(UART)

* ![R2](artwork/r2_2.jpg)

* And same for SPI, SSH and Camera

### Configuring Raspberry Pi and Running the UI
  1.  Copy FirmwareRPi folder to the desktop of your Raspberry Pi, open the terminal of your Raspberry Pi and execute the following commands

```bash
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get upgrade
  - sudo apt install python3-pip
  - pip3 install paho-mqtt
  - pip3 install imusensor
  - sudo adduser $USER dialout
  - sudo cp imuSrv.service /lib/systemd/system/
  - {TCP Tunnel}
  - sudo apt-get install motion
```
After the installation is complete, type in the command `sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf` and press enter.

Then you have to change some settings in the `.conf` file. It might be difficult sometimes to find the settings but use 'ctrl + w' to find it. So follow the steps:

1.  Make sure 'daemon' is ON.
2.  Set 'framerate' anywhere in between 1000 to 1500.
3.  Keep 'Stream_port' to 8081.
4.  'Stream_quality' should be 100.
5.  Change 'Stream_localhost' to OFF.
6.  Change 'webcontrol_localhost' to OFF.
7.  Set 'quality' to 100.
8.  Set 'width' & 'height' to 640 & 480.
9.  Set 'post_capture' to 5.
10. Press ctrl + x to exit. Type y to save and enter to confirm.
11. Again type in the command `sudo nano /etc/default/motion` and press enter.

12. Set ' start_motion_daemon ' to yes. Save and exit.

Then do:

`sudo service motion restart`
`sudo motion` 

Once done, import `flows.json` to the nodered, form `dashboard` folder.
### Installing and Configuring Node-RED on Raspberry Pi

Conifguring NodeRED, MQTT is required only one time.

Open the terminal and execute the following commands

```
- sudo apt install ufw
- sudo ufw enable
- sudo ufw allow tcp http https 1883 8883 1880 80 8080 443
```
##### Installing MQTT(Mosquitto)
Open the terminal and execute the following commands

```
- sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
- sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service
- mosquitto -v
```

1.  To run the program just restart the raspberry pi.

This program make use of MQTT to communicate with the webapp.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Testing <a name = "test"></a>

1.  The Firmware can be tested on Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4B with the following modifications
  1.  Connect the sensor as shown in the Circuit Diagram section below.
